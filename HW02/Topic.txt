Problem 1:
Implementation of Huffman Coding

Participants can do simple implementation for alphabets with any probability vector as presented in the class.


Problem 2:

Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm to perform Vector Quantization or any variants of LBG can also be considered for implementation.


Participants can work on any image data-sets (even for a single image is fine) for training and implementation.


Programming language - MATLAB, C++, Python & so on.
